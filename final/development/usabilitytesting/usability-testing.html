            <h2>Sky</h2>
            <p class="bold">No Back Button to Home Page</p>
            <p>Sky tested our mobile app on desktop in the inspect view so it was a bit more difficult to zoom in and
                out of the map. There is also no back button on the map page to return to the home page, which was
                confusing.</p>

            <p class="bold">Face filter needs to be updated</p>
            <p>Sky noticed that the camera on the face filter is not mirroring like usual front facing cameras. As a
                result, it is a little bit disorienting to use the filters. Sky also mentioned that it would be good to
                have a way to take a photo and download them.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Kelly</h2>
            <p class="bold">Easy to Navigate</p>
            <p>Kelly tested the site on a mobile phone so it was easier to zoom in and out of the map. Back buttons on the pop ups made it easy to navigate between them.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">Substitute an instruction page for a brief description</p>
            <p>Kelly recommended that we have a brief description of our app underneath our header instead of having a separate instructions page.</p>

            <p class="bold">Face filters are flattering</p>
            <p>Face filters sometimes took a while to load but were mostly located underneath the cheeks which were flattering. Like Sky, Kelly noticed how the camera for the face filters was not mirrored which made it a little difficult to use.</p>
