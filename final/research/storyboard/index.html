    <p>During our feedback session, we got the suggestion to shift our target audience from elementary school kids to incoming students at UC Davis orientation. I think this will be more successful because this population usually has access to phones and are able to go around downtown Davis. Additionally, we received recommendations to use the leaflet library for the map section of our app instead of trying to teach ourselves how to use AR js.</p>
