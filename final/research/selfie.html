        <p>One thing I found really interesting about the seal was that it is designed to look like a bike wheel with its spokes. Biking is such a key part of Davis' identity so it is really cool to see how it was integrated very elegantly and subtly into this piece. I also thought it was interesting how the artist used the spokes as a metaphor for how different highways and railroads intersect Davis.</p>
