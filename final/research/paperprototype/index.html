    <p>During our testing session, our partners had difficulty figuring out how to exit the AR mode and would press on the title of the location instead of the done button. Additionally, there was some confusion on the map about how to open a pop up for a new location after completing a previous one. There was also some confusion around what we were doing exactly and it was not super clear we were using AR since it's hard to distinguish between illustrations and photos in paper prototypes.</p>
