        <h2>Laura Yien</h2>
        <p>For my capstone project, I want to create a scavenger hunt mobile game where users can visit historically significant places in Davis while learning new things and collecting virtual prizes. Pokemon Go and the Aquarium Scavenger Hunt App for the Children's Aquarium in Dallas, TX have similar concepts to mine.

                <p>Pokémon Go is probably the most well known scavenger hunt mobile game. It has a map interface which allows the user to see where they are in real time. It also allows users to catch Pokémon and complete series of quests to gain rewards (in the form of Pokemon, items, or player customization). I want to draw from the interface of Pokémon Go, which uses an overhead of the player and displays a map.</p>

            <div class="written">
                <p>This app was made through the Children's Aquarium in Dallas and is similar to my proposed concept because it is an educational app. It encourages kids to scan QR codes around the aquarium which correspond to different animal exhibits they have there. Kids can add the animals they've collected to their own virtual aquarium, which encourages them to check out all the exhibits there. I want to incorporate these features in the game that I build.</p>
