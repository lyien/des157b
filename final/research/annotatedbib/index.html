            <p>This web page curated by the Archives and Special Collections division of the UC Davis Library compiles basic information about each of the historical buildings on the UC Davis campus. Information noted include architect, year created, cost, materials, and history behind the buildings' purposes and construction. Since I am making a scavenger hunt game which incorporates historical facts, this website is useful for identifying historic buildings to be included. It also provides basic information about the buildings' purposes and significance to the UC Davis community, which can be displayed in the game.</p>

            <h2><a href="davisdowntown.com/portfolio-items/mcdonald-house-1894/?portfolioCats=71">Davis Downtown</a></h2>
            <p>This website is an archive of different historical buildings in downtown Davis. It does not have photos, but has the name of the buildings and a brief description of the origin and significance. I am planning on using this archive to help determine which buildings to include on the scavenger hunt game in downtown Davis. There is no author listed, which does make it seem like this website may not be reliable, however the website is sponsored by UC Davis and the Yolo County Visitors Bureau which adds credibility.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://theclio.com/tour/472/2">History of Davis California Walking Tour</a></h2>
            <p>This is a virtual walking tour of Davis created on the website Clio, which allows users to create walking tours of different towns throughout the US. This one in particular focuses on the history of Davis and combines images of the buildings pulled from Google Maps along with descriptions of each building. I want to create something similar to this walking tour except on a mobile device with location tracking. This website is especially helpful because of the images it provides for each of the buildings.</p>
