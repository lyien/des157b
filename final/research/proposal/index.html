        <p>For my capstone project, I want to create a scavenger hunt mobile game where users can go to visit historically significant places in Davis. This will promote education about Davis History and drive interest into local businesses and historical monuments. The target audience for this project are kids ages 9-12, but will be appropriate for older ages. I am planning on working on this independently. Some features I want to incorporate are a map of Davis where players can see game locations, tokens/prices as rewards for visiting places in the game, and historical facts to promote education. </p>

        <p>One thing I'm not sure about is how it would work as a location based game. Would I need to rely on QR codes or could I use geolocation? Additionally, does my idea for this project have to be unique or is it okay if it is similar to the projects that my peers are working on? Would it be counterproductive if we all made the same type of game for the city?
